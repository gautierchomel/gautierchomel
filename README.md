The press says it all :)

> *"Behold, Gautier Chomel, the extraordinaire project manager at EDRLab! With a whopping 25 years in editorial and book production design, he's not just an expert—he's a walking, talking library of the craft. But hold onto your hats, folks, because there's more! For the past 12 years, he's been on a crusade to make content accessible for print disabled folks, proving that superheroes also deserve ebooks :)*

> *Gautier isn't your average trainer; he's collaborated with the heavyweights like WIPO and the Daisy Consortium. And if that wasn't enough, he runs his own certified training center, éditadapt. When he's not revolutionizing the world one accessible book at a time, you'll find him hand printing with 3D matrices—because who needs ordinary hobbies when you can have full-blown obsessions?*

> *So, if you ever need someone to save the day with accessible content or just want to chat about the intricacies of 3D printing, Gautier's your guy. Just don't be surprised if he starts geeking out over book production techniques—it's all part of the charm!"*
