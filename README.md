Extraordinaire project manager at EDRLab! With 25 years under his belt in editorial and book production design, he's practically a walking encyclopedia of the trade. But wait, there's more! For the past 12 years, he's been on a mission to make content accessible for print disabled folks, because superheroes also deserve ebooks :)

Not just any trainer; he's worked with the big guns like WIPO and the Daisy Consortium. He even runs his own certified training center, éditadapt. And when he's not enhancing the world one accessible book at a time, you can find him hand printing with 3D matrices—because who needs hobbies when you can have obsessions?
